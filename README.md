# accessibility-project

This is a website that has been made accessible to those that use screenreaders.

My motivation for this website is to promote inclusivity and accessability to all and to practice my skills while following accessability standards.

In this website I have implemented HTML Semantic Elements and ARIA-Labels and alt text on each relevant asset.

The HTML follows a logical structure independent of styling and positioning, heading attributes fall in a sequential order and title elements contain a concise, descriptive title.

In this project I learned about the importance of ARIA, I only needed to use it once in this project though, for the "hero" image to allow screenreaders to read the alt text since it is not just a regular image that we can apply the alt property to, it is a background image on the pages hero.

I also learned how to add alt text and how to organise and establish heirarchy in both HTML and CSS files.

# Usage
To view the accesibility aspects of this website simply open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (windows), or right clicking the webpage and clicking Inspect. A console panel will open up to the right or below the webpage in the browser and you will see the organised html following the semantics of Header ,Body, Section, Article and Aside. 

You can also simply right click on any element of the website you would like to see the alt text and click Inspect to be able to view that specific element right away without having to dig through the html.
